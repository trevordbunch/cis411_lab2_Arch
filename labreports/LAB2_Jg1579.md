# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [/ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [/ ] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [ /] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central is a mobile application that allows users to find events that are looking for volunteer opportunitites. On the app you are able to see the type of events,location of events, and skills needed for events.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  


| Use Case #1 |Volunteer|
|---|---|
| Title | Signing up to volunteer |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> User will login to their account </li><li> User authenticates identity<li> User searches through desired events based on the time, event type, and location </li><li> User selects an event and fills out required information </li><li> User will confirm their registration </li><li> User is given registration confirmation </li><li> User is directed back to original search page  |
| Primary Actor |Volunteer |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> User has created an account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> User is notified of completed signup </li><li> User is notified with instructions about the event and any changes that may occur  |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title |Creating Volunteering Event |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> Orgainization will login to their account </li><li>Oranization authenticates identity<li> Organization selects new event registration </li><li> Organization fills out information about event </li><li> Organizations confirms registering their event </li><li> Organization is given confirmation of registered event </li><li> Organization is directed back to original page |
| Primary Actor |Organization |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> Organization has created an organization account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use  |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> Organization is notified of completed event registration </li><li> Organisation confirms event is real <li>Event is displayed so that volnteers can see it| 

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
|Service Events  | Available Events  |EventController  |
|User Registration |User Account Registration  |UserRegistrationController  |
|Event Location  |Event Information  |EventLocationController  |
|Event  |Event Registration  |EventRegistrationController  |


## Step 2.3 Diagram a Use Case in Architectural Terms

The web app html sends display info via a GUI to the user. The user sends input info back to the web app. The input is then sent to the sever. The server then sends a data request to the database. Afterwardsthe database sends data which is then converted by the server and sent to the web app. The web app then displays the info.

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
I would try to use the Broker architecture. This archiecture meets the two new requirements because it declutters all the services through a communication broker. Thirdparty services to input and retrieve data from our datastore, and the building of organization-specific interfaces would be brokered so that they don't run the risk of interfering with each other and the main ServeCentral database. This will make service distrubion transparent to the clients and supports dynamic editing of entities. However this architecture runs the risk of adding two many factors to keep control of, and may be complex to handle.

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
The Architectural pattern that I would employ with all these new needs would be microservice. This is now a big enough company with well defined boundries that we should incorporate a number of different tiny programs instead of buidling one big one for every new feature we want to add such as supporting a volunteer and event data store that will exceed 50TB of data. Some downsides that this may cause is the confusion of uses as parts of the app appear later than others, and the communication costs can be significant due to how spread apart the tasks are. But since this is a rapidly developing company, we need this sort of Architecture. These new changes are needed because technology is advancing and our company needs to advance with it, but mainly since we are gaining a ton of new users, we need are going to need more data space, and enhancements that will keep the users happy and coming back.
