# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [/ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [/ ] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [ /] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central is a mobile application that allows users to find events that are looking for volunteer opportunitites. On the app you are able to see the type of events,location of events, and skills needed for events.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  


| Use Case #1 |Volunteer|
|---|---|
| Title | Signing up to volunteer |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> User will login to their account </li><li> User authenticates identity<li> User searches through desired events based on the time, event type, and location </li><li> User selects an event and fills out required information </li><li> User will confirm their registration </li><li> User is given registration confirmation </li><li> User is directed back to original search page  |
| Primary Actor |Volunteer |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> User has created an account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> User is notified of completed signup </li><li> User is notified with instructions about the event and any changes that may occur  |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title |Creating Volunteering Event |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> Orgainization will login to their account </li><li>Oranization authenticates identity<li> Organization selects new event registration </li><li> Organization fills out information about event </li><li> Organizations confirms registering their event </li><li> Organization is given confirmation of registered event </li><li> Organization is directed back to original page |
| Primary Actor |Organization |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> Organization has created an organization account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use  |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> Organization is notified of completed event registration </li><li> Organisation confirms event is real <li>Event is displayed so that volnteers can see it| 

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
|Service Events  | Available Events  |EventController  |
|User Registration |User Account Registration  |UserRegistrationController  |
|Event Location  |Event Information  |EventLocationController  |
|Event  |Event Registration  |EventRegistrationController  |


## Step 2.3 Diagram a Use Case in Architectural Terms
![image](/assets/ASSET2.3.jpg)
The web app html sends display info via a GUI to the user. The user sends input info back to the web app. The input is then sent to the sever. The server then sends a data request to the database. Afterwardsthe database sends data which is then converted by the server and sent to the web app. The web app then displays the info.

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
I would try to use the Broker architecture. This archiecture meets the two new requirements because it is a declutterer. Thirdparty services to input and retrieve data from our datastore, and the building of organization-specific interfaces would be brokered so that they don't run the risk of messing with other parts of the system. This will make service distrubion clear to the clients and supports dynamic editing of entities. However this architecture may add too many features and bug down the system in over-complexity.


## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
The Architectural pattern that I would employ with all these new needs would be microservice. This is now a large enough and defined enough company we should incorporate a number of different small programs instead of buidling one a large one for every new update we want to add such as supporting a volunteer and event data store that will exceed 50TB of data. Some downsides that this may cause is the confusion of uses as parts of the app before others, and the communication costs can be significant due to how spread apart the tasks are. 
# Extra Credit
It may be good for you to include a section talking about failsafes for the system. In more modern times there are multiple factors that may push the sytem beyond what it is capable at the time. So there should be something in place that protects or resets the system in the worst case scenrio. Like a backup copy that is on a seperate location or network. While this is a bit more into the cyber secuirty side it is good for people making the systems to keep this in mind as well. It would save money and resources if they prepared for the worst case scenerio in the first place.
