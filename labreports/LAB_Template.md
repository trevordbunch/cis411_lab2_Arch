# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central is a responsive web design that solves the problem of finding new and consistent leads in regards to volunteering research. Serve Central will be a user friendly application that allows the suer to have their own account, search for local events, and sign up for events they desire to help with.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Signing up for an event |
| Description / Steps | Description: The volunteer selects a specific event they would like to sign up for.
Setps: 1. The volunteer inserts their zip code into a search bar. 2. The system provides available volunteer events within a 25 mile radius of the given zip code. 3. The volunteer selects a provided volunteer event. 4. The system displays more detailed information about the selected event, such as: date, time, location, job responsibilities, etc. 5. The voluteer selects "Sign up for event". 6. The system pulls the volunteers' information and sends it to the manager of that event. 7. Manager is notified.  |
| Primary Actor | Volunteer |
| Preconditions | 1. The volunteer is authenticated by logging into his/her account. 2. The availability of volunteer events is online.|
| Postconditions | 1. Volunteers who have signed up for events is stored in the system. 2. The manager of that event is notified of the new volunteer. |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Creating an Event|
| Description / Steps | Description: The service agencies can create an event for volunteers to sign up for.
Steps: 1. The system asks basic questions about the project at hand, such as: the mission, time, date, location, jobs required, etc. 2. The service agency fills out the information about their volunteer event. 3. The system sends the information to the application to be listed as a possible event for volunteers to sign up for and attend. |
| Primary Actor | Service Agencies |
| Preconditions | 1. The service agency must complete a "background check" to make sure they are a real organization. 2. The prompted information is completely filled out by the service agency.|
| Postconditions | 1. The event is posted to the application page.|

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| Events | Current Events | Add Event |
| Volunteers | Current Volunteers | Add Volunteer  |
| Organizations | Organizations | Add Organization |
| Locations | Current Locations | Add Location |

## Step 2.3 Diagram a Use Case in Architectural Terms

Description: The view, in this case the current events, is the only thing that the volunteer can see. The view is altered by the controller, "add event". This controller has a two way relationship the model of "events" which would be connected to the database.

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal

The new architecure should be built on a peer to peer format. This will give equal control to all nodes involved in the system. This format will be ideal due to the fact that thirdparty services will now have access to input and retreive data since all nodes are now equal. Their is no heirarchy to this system. Also, the new organization-specific interfaces of Serve Central will not cause harm to the data logic since it will be decentralized. Along with a decentalized execution and communication, there is also limited redundency. However, for peer-to-peer architecture to be effective, there must be a deep consideration of a continuous release as well as observability strategy. For Serve Central, this would look like constantly being up to date with what is going on in the system and how to make it better.

## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture

In this instance, there will be no dramatic changes to the arcitecture design simply due to the fact that it is already in peer-to-peer form from the latest scale increase. Peer-to-peer is definitley the best choice for this system design for multiple reasons. One of the largest reasons is due to the fact that such a large amount of other users will need access to the authorization to issue queries of this system. Within the peer-to-peer architectural design, an unlimited number of people will be able to access and modify the system as they deem fit. One of the downsides to this system is that since such a large number of people are going to be modifying, there will be a lack of communication between all of the new modifiers. I believe there will need to be "nice-to-have enhancements" since there will be such a large uproar in new users, but nothing significant since overall, it is the same system in place.
